<p>In this tutorial we used BOSH to deploy services, updated our deployment with source changes, scaled the number of services and changed their properties. We recovered from failing service, failing VM and failing deploy.</p>

<p>We were using bosh-lite that comes with warden CPI (Cloud Provider Interface). Warden is a Linux container management tool and warden CPI abstracts VMs as Linux containers. BOSH director can work with any CPI that implements a certain API to manage resources. There are several supported CPIs for different IaaS providers: AWS, Openstack, vSphere and vCloud. Read more about CPIs here: <a href="http://bosh.io/docs/cpi-api-v1.html">http://bosh.io/docs/cpi-api-v1.html</a>.</p>

<p>Bosh-lite comes with pre-installed Director. <b>bosh-init</b> provides a way to install initial VM with BOSH Director on any IaaS. Read more about it here: <a href="http://bosh.io/docs/using-bosh-init.html">http://bosh.io/docs/using-bosh-init.html</a>.</p>
